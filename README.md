# Hello, dear colleagues!
We are in the process of making a battleship game.
This is our project so far, it isn't complete, but you can start the game, give your players a name and place your ships.

Have fun while trying out what we have so far!
You can run the project with: View > Tool Windows > Gradle > Tasks > application > run

Sincerely,
the team from "Project 44"
