# Hello, dear colleagues!
We are in the process of making a battleship game.
This is our project so far, it isn't complete, but you can start the game, give your players a name, place your ships and shoot.

Manual:

1. First type in your players name
2. Choose a ship to place
3. Then choose if you want it to be placed horizontal or vertical
4. Place the ship
5. Continue until there is no ship left to place
6. Player 2 follows the same steps as Player 1 before
7. You can shoot, if the field turns red, you hit a ship, if it turns blue, you hit water
8. If you successfully hit a ship, you have another shot.
9. The player who shot all ships from the opponent wins!

Have fun while trying out what we have so far.
You can run the project with: View > Tool Windows > Gradle > Tasks > Application > Run

Sincerely,

the team from
"Project 44"
